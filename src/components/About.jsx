      <h2>My Schooling</h2><br />
      <p>
        I have almost completed my EdEx bootcamp through the University of Utah<br />
        and I could not be more proud of the progress I have made. My day job<br />
        is with the State of Utah as a Real Estate Investigator and<br />
        while I do enjoy my job, I also wanted to learn a new skill.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning React, Mongo, MySQL, JavaScript, Node.js, Express MERN and<br />
        other programming languages has been so rewarding. I have been<br />
        frustrated many times, but am proud of the work I have done and the<br />
        effort put into learning it all. I know I have a long way to go, and I<br />
        am looking forward to it!
      </p><br />
      <h2>My Work History</h2><br />
      <p> As mentioned above, I work for the Utah Division of Real Estate as a Real Estate Investigator.<br /> 
      In some ways it is a lot like fullstack programming. It takes the same dedication to find answers<br />
      and solve problems in finding information. It definetly has it's differences as well. I have many<br /> 
      ideas that have been implemented in my current job. I have created appScript spreadsheets<br />
