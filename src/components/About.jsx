      <h1> About me</h1>

      
      <h2>Schooling</h2>
      <p>
        I have almost completed my EdEx bootcamp throught he University of Utah
        and I could not be more proud of the progress I have made. My day job
        currenty is with the State of Utah as a Real Estate Investigator and
        while I do enjoy my job, I also wanted to learn a new skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning React, Mongo, MySQL, JavaScript, Node.js, Express MERN and
        other programming languages has been so rewarding. I have been
        frustrated many times, but am proud of the work I have done and the
        effort put into learning it all. I know I have a long way to go, and I
        am looking forward to it!
      </p>
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p> As mentioned above, I work for the Utah Division of Real Estate as a Real Estate Investigator. In some ways it is 
        a lot like fullstack programming. It takes the same dedication to find answers, and solve problems in finding information.
        It definetly has it's differences as well.
