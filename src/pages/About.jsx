      <h2>Full Stack Education</h2>
      <br /><p>
        I have almost completed my EdEx bootcamp through the University of Utah and I could not <br />
        be more proud of the progress I have made. My day job is with the State of Utah as a <br /> 
        Real Estate Investigator and while I do enjoy my job, I also wanted to learn a new skill.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning React, Mongo, MySQL, JavaScript, Node.js, Express MERN and other programming <br />
        languages has been so rewarding. I have been frustrated many times, but am proud of the <br /> 
        work I have done and the effort put into learning it all. I know I have a long way to go until<br />
        I am where I want to be, and I am looking forward to the process!
      </p>
      <h2>My Work History</h2>
      <p> As mentioned above, I work for the Utah Division of Real Estate as a Real Estate Investigator.<br /> 
      In some ways it is a lot like fullstack programming. It takes the same dedication to find answers<br />
      and solve problems in finding information. It definetly has it's differences as well. I have many<br /> 
      ideas that have been implemented in my current job. I have created appScript spreadsheets<br />
