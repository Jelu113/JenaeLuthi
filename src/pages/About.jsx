      <h2>Professional Development in Full Stack Technologies</h2>
      <p>
      I am on the verge of completing the EdEx bootcamp offered by the University of Utah, and I take<br />
      great pride in the substantial progress I have achieved. Currently employed as a Real Estate<br /> 
      Investigator with the State of Utah, I have found fulfillment in my professional role but also sought<br /> 
      to acquire a new skill set.
      </p>
      <p>
      My educational journey has encompassed a comprehensive exploration of technologies such as<br /> 
      React, Mongo, MySQL, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express MERN, among other programming languages.<br /> 
      Despite encountering moments of frustration, I am pleased with the substantial work I have accomplished<br /> 
      and the commitment I have devoted to the learning process. Recognizing that I have a substantial path <br /> 
      ahead to reach my desired proficiency, I eagerly anticipate the continued evolution of my skills.
      </p>
      <h2>Professional Background</h2>
      <p>In addition to my ongoing education, I contribute to the Utah Division of Real Estate as a <br />
      Real Estate Investigator. Drawing parallels between my role and full-stack programming, I recognize the <br />
      shared commitment required to unearth solutions and address challenges in the pursuit of information. <br />
      While distinctions exist, my current position has provided a fertile ground for the implementation of <br />
      numerous ideas. I have successfully developed appScript spreadsheets as part of my contributions to <br />
      optimizing processes within my present role.
